# Laravel Best Practices

This repo is a **JSON API** (see `.cursor/rules/property-offers-api.mdc`). Project rules override generic examples below.

- Business logic: **`app/Services/<Name>/` + `*ServiceInterface`**. Do not add Action classes.
- Inject **interfaces** for every domain service, not only external gateways.
- **No auth** on `/api/v1` — no policies, gates, Sanctum, or session.
- HTTP: **API v1 envelope** via `ApiServiceInterface` — not `view()` / `redirect()` / raw `response()->json()`.
- **No Blade, Inertia, or Vue.** Skip `rules/blade-views.md`.
- Queues: Docker `queue` worker + Redis. Do not add Horizon.
- Enums: `app/Services/<Name>/Enumerators/<Name>Enumerator.php`.
- No session helpers. Date-times in API JSON: ISO 8601 UTC with `Z`.

Exact API syntax: `search-docs`. Architecture detail: `.cursor/rules/laravel-architecture.mdc` and `api-v1.mdc`.

## Consistency First

Before applying any rule, check what the application already does. Laravel offers multiple valid approaches — the best choice is the one the codebase already uses, even if another pattern would be theoretically better. Inconsistency is worse than a suboptimal pattern.

Check sibling files, related controllers, models, or tests for established patterns. If one exists, follow it — don't introduce a second way. These rules are defaults for when no pattern exists yet, not overrides.

## Quick Reference

### 1. Database Performance → `rules/db-performance.md`

- Eager load with `with()` to prevent N+1 queries
- Enable `Model::preventLazyLoading()` in development
- Select only needed columns, avoid `SELECT *`
- `chunk()` / `chunkById()` for large datasets
- Index columns used in `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`
- `withCount()` instead of loading relations to count
- `cursor()` for memory-efficient read-only iteration
- Select only needed columns, avoid `SELECT *`

### 2. Advanced Query Patterns → `rules/advanced-queries.md`

- `addSelect()` subqueries over eager-loading entire has-many for a single value
- Dynamic relationships via subquery FK + `belongsTo`
- Conditional aggregates (`CASE WHEN` in `selectRaw`) over multiple count queries
- `setRelation()` to prevent circular N+1 queries
- `whereIn` + `pluck()` over `whereHas` for better index usage
- Two simple queries can beat one complex query
- Compound indexes matching `orderBy` column order
- Correlated subqueries in `orderBy` for has-many sorting (avoid joins)

### 3. Security → `rules/security.md`

- Define `$fillable` or `$guarded` on every model
- No raw SQL with user input — use Eloquent or query builder
- `throttle` on `/api/v1` routes (there is no login)
- Validate MIME type, extension, and size for file uploads
- Never commit `.env`, use `config()` for secrets, `encrypted` cast for sensitive DB fields

### 4. Caching → `rules/caching.md`

- `Cache::remember()` over manual get/put
- `Cache::flexible()` for stale-while-revalidate on high-traffic data
- `Cache::memo()` to avoid redundant cache hits within a request
- Cache tags to invalidate related groups
- `Cache::add()` for atomic conditional writes
- `once()` to memoize per-request or per-object lifetime
- `Cache::lock()` / `lockForUpdate()` for race conditions
- Failover cache stores in production

### 5. Eloquent Patterns → `rules/eloquent.md`

- Correct relationship types with return type hints
- Local scopes for reusable query constraints
- Global scopes sparingly — document their existence
- Attribute casts in the `casts()` method
- Cast date columns; API JSON uses ISO 8601 UTC with `Z` (`ApiDateTimeFormatter`)
- `whereBelongsTo($model)` for cleaner queries
- Never hardcode table names — use `(new Model)->getTable()` or Eloquent queries

### 6. Validation & Forms → `rules/validation.md`

- Form Request classes, not inline validation
- Array notation `['required', 'email']` for new code; follow existing convention
- `$request->validated()` only — never `$request->all()`
- `Rule::when()` for conditional validation
- `after()` instead of `withValidator()`

### 7. Configuration → `rules/config.md`

- `env()` only inside config files
- `App::environment()` or `app()->isProduction()`
- Config, lang files, and constants over hardcoded text

### 8. Testing Patterns → `rules/testing.md`

- `LazilyRefreshDatabase` over `RefreshDatabase` for speed
- `assertModelExists()` over raw `assertDatabaseHas()`
- Factory states and sequences over manual overrides
- Use fakes (`Event::fake()`, `Exceptions::fake()`, etc.) — but always after factory setup, not before
- `recycle()` to share relationship instances across factories

### 9. Queue & Job Patterns → `rules/queue-jobs.md`

- `retry_after` must exceed job `timeout`; use exponential backoff `[1, 5, 10]`
- `ShouldBeUnique` to prevent duplicates; `ShouldBeUniqueUntilProcessing` for early lock release
- Always implement `failed()`; with `retryUntil()`, set `$tries = 0`
- `RateLimited` middleware for external API calls; `Bus::batch()` for related jobs
- Process jobs with the Docker `queue` service (`queue:work redis`) — not Horizon

### 10. Routing & Controllers → `rules/routing.md`

- Implicit route model binding
- Scoped bindings for nested resources
- `Route::apiResource()` under `/api/v1`
- Methods under 10 lines — extract to **services**
- Type-hint Form Requests; return via `ApiServiceInterface`

### 11. HTTP Client → `rules/http-client.md`

- Explicit `timeout` and `connectTimeout` on every request
- `retry()` with exponential backoff for external APIs
- Check response status or use `throw()`
- `Http::pool()` for concurrent independent requests
- `Http::fake()` and `preventStrayRequests()` in tests

### 12. Events, Notifications & Mail → `rules/events-notifications.md`, `rules/mail.md`

- Event discovery over manual registration; `event:cache` in production
- `ShouldDispatchAfterCommit` / `afterCommit()` inside transactions
- Queue notifications and mailables with `ShouldQueue`
- On-demand notifications for non-user recipients
- `HasLocalePreference` on notifiable models
- `assertQueued()` not `assertSent()` for queued mailables
- Markdown mailables for transactional emails

### 13. Error Handling → `rules/error-handling.md`

- `report()`/`render()` on exception classes or in `bootstrap/app.php` — follow existing pattern
- `ShouldntReport` for exceptions that should never log
- Throttle high-volume exceptions to protect log sinks
- `dontReportDuplicates()` for multi-catch scenarios
- Force JSON rendering for API routes
- Structured context via `context()` on exception classes

### 14. Task Scheduling → `rules/scheduling.md`

- `withoutOverlapping()` on variable-duration tasks
- `onOneServer()` on multi-server deployments
- `runInBackground()` for concurrent long tasks
- `environments()` to restrict to appropriate environments
- `takeUntilTimeout()` for time-bounded processing
- Schedule groups for shared configuration

### 15. Architecture → `rules/architecture.md`

- Domain **services** + interfaces; dependency injection over `app()` helper
- Prefer official Laravel packages and follow conventions, don't override defaults
- Default to `ORDER BY id DESC` or `created_at DESC`; `mb_*` for UTF-8 safety
- `defer()` for post-response work; `Context` for request-scoped data; `Concurrency::run()` for parallel execution

### 16. Migrations → `rules/migrations.md`

- Generate migrations with `php artisan make:migration`
- `constrained()` for foreign keys
- Never modify migrations that have run in production
- Add indexes in the migration, not as an afterthought
- Mirror column defaults in model `$attributes`
- Reversible `down()` by default; forward-fix migrations for intentionally irreversible changes
- One concern per migration — never mix DDL and DML

### 17. Collections → `rules/collections.md`

- Higher-order messages for simple collection operations
- `cursor()` vs. `lazy()` — choose based on relationship needs
- `lazyById()` when updating records while iterating
- `toQuery()` for bulk operations on collections

### 18. Blade & Views → skip

This application has **no frontend**. Do not add Blade, Inertia, or Vue. Ignore `rules/blade-views.md`.

### 19. Conventions & Style → `rules/style.md`

- Follow Laravel naming; domain enums are `*Enumerator` (see `laravel-architecture`)
- Prefer Laravel helpers (`Str`, `Arr`, `Number`, `Uri`) over raw PHP functions
- No HTML in PHP classes; no session helpers
- Code should be readable; comments only for config files

## How to Apply

Always use a sub-agent to read rule files and explore this skill's content.

1. Identify the file type and select relevant sections (e.g. migration → §16, controller → §1, §3, §5, §6, §10, §15). Skip §18.
2. Prefer `.cursor/rules/` over examples in this skill when they disagree
3. Verify API syntax with `search-docs` for the installed Laravel version
